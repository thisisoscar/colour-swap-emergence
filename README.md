# colour-swap-emergence

image_manipulation is the file I should rename to main.py. It takes a jpeg image called '0.jpg' and the code goes through each pixel and calculates its average rgb colour value. It does the same with the pixels to its side and chooses the pixel with the largest difference. The colours of these pixels then switch and it 'moves'. The new image that is created is saved as '{n+1}.jpg'. After enough iterations, it calls two video compilers to create the video that is created at I think 5 or 10 fps. If you want to use this, you need to manually set the number of iterations on all compilers and you might want to tweak some settings
